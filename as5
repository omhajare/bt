Ass 5 - Hyperledger Fabric application 

Requires to run Linux/ubuntu commands 
Windows user : 
Make sure to do windows setup for that before following these steps!
🧠 What the Project Is
This is a full-stack web app that lets you interact with a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain — for example:
See assets stored on the blockchain,


Create new assets,


Register users, etc.


The backend (Node.js/Express) talks to the Fabric network through the Fabric SDK, and the frontend (HTML/JS) provides a UI for you.

🧩 How It Works (High-Level Flow)
You set up a Fabric blockchain network locally using Docker containers.


You deploy a smart contract (chaincode) called asset-transfer-basic.


You start the web app, which connects to that network.


You use the browser UI to enroll users, create/query assets, etc.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
This downloads the project files from GitHub to your local system.
git clone https://github.com/PrashantPatil10178/BT-5.git
cd BT-5

After this:
You’ll have a folder BT-5/


Inside it are files like setup.sh, package.json, and source code.

Step 2: Install Dependencies
This installs all Node.js packages the web app needs (like Express, Fabric SDK, etc.):
npm install
You’ll see a folder named node_modules created.

Step 3: Run the Setup Script (setup.sh)
This is the heart of the setup.
 Instead of you manually starting Fabric, deploying chaincode, and configuring things, this script automates everything.
Run it:
./setup.sh



If you’re on macOS, this will execute directly. If you get an error, create a new setup_mac.sh file in the directory :
```
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "📦 Updating Homebrew..."
brew update

echo "🔧 Installing dependencies (git, jq, docker, dos2unix)..."
brew install git jq dos2unix

# Docker Desktop provides docker and docker-compose
if ! command -v docker &>/dev/null; then
  echo "🐳 Please install Docker Desktop manually from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/"
  open https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
  exit 1
fi

echo "📦 Installing Node.js (LTS)..."
brew install node

echo "🐹 Installing Go..."
brew install go

echo "✅ Verifying installations..."
node --version
npm --version
go version
docker --version
docker-compose version

echo "📥 Downloading Hyperledger Fabric samples and binaries..."
curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s

cd fabric-samples/test-network

echo "Unix-ifying scripts (running dos2unix)..."
dos2unix ./network.sh

echo "🧹 Cleaning up existing network..."
./network.sh down

echo "🚀 Starting Fabric network and creating channel named 'channel'..."
./network.sh up createChannel -c channel

echo "📦 Deploying basic chaincode to channel 'channel'..."
./network.sh deployCC -ccn basic -ccp ../asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-javascript -ccl javascript -c channel

echo "✅ Setup complete! The Fabric network is up and running on channel 'channel'."
```
Run Now : 
./setup_mac.sh
Step 4: 
Starts the Web Server
Finally, it runs:
npm run dev

which launches the web app (Express server) at http://localhost:3000.



🧹 To Stop Everything Later
When you’re done:
# Stop the web app (Ctrl + C)
# Then stop the Fabric network:
cd ../fabric-samples/test-network
./network.sh down
