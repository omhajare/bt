Creating a crypto wallet using metamask!!

A Wallet (MetaMask): This is your digital identity and wallet on the blockchain.
Action: Go to metamask.io and install the browser extension.
For me I’ve just sign up from google account and then recovered my private key and Recovery phrase from setting and stored in Password app!!
Follow the setup to create your first wallet. WRITE DOWN YOUR 12-WORD SECRET RECOVERY PHRASE on paper and store it somewhere safe. This is your only backup.

Terms must know!!
What is Ethereum?
Ethereum is a blockchain network that allows you not just to store transactions, but also run code on it.
 That code is called a smart contract.
So while Bitcoin is mostly for money transfers, Ethereum lets you create programs (decentralized apps, games, finance protocols, etc.) that live on the blockchain.

🔹 What is a Smart Contract?
A smart contract is like a small program stored on the blockchain.
 It runs automatically when certain conditions are met.
Example:
function wave() public {
    totalWaves += 1;
}

Whenever someone calls wave(), it adds +1 to the counter.
 The contract itself stores this number forever (until you redeploy).
These programs are written in Solidity (a language similar to JavaScript or C++).

🔹 What is a Wallet?
A wallet in blockchain = your identity.
It has two keys:
Public key → your “address” (like your bank account number)


Private key → your password (used to sign transactions)


You’ll use a wallet (like MetaMask) to:
Store crypto (like ETH)


Sign transactions (approve sending, deploying contracts)


Connect to decentralized apps (dApps)


For this experiment, we’ll create a wallet in MetaMask and use test ETH (fake coins) from a testnet.

⚙️ 2. SETUP — Hardhat + Local Blockchain
🧩 What is Hardhat?
Hardhat is a developer tool that lets you:
Create a local Ethereum blockchain (like a personal mini-network)


Compile & test smart contracts


Deploy to local or public networks (like testnets)


Debug & interact with contracts


It’s like a developer environment for Ethereum.
