Next step (for Assignment 2(b)) will involve:
Deploying this same contract on a public testnet (like Sepolia)


Connecting MetaMask wallet


Creating a simple web frontend that interacts with it

Step 1 : Get Your "Real World" Tools (One-Time Setup)
Before we can deploy, you need three things you don't need for local-only testing:
A Wallet (MetaMask): This is your digital identity and wallet on the blockchain.
Action: Go to metamask.io and install the browser extension.
For me I’ve just signed up from a google account and then recovered my private key and Recovery phrase from settings and stored them in Passwords app!!
Follow the setup to create your first wallet. WRITE DOWN YOUR 12-WORD SECRET RECOVERY PHRASE on paper and store it somewhere safe. This is your only backup.

Test Money (Sepolia ETH): We need "fake" money to pay for the "gas" (transaction fees) to deploy our contract on a public test network.
The assignment mentions Rinkeby/Ropsten, but those are deprecated (no longer used). The modern, standard testnet is Sepolia.
Action:
In MetaMask, go to network tab and select "Sepolia". (You may need to toggle "Show test networks" in settings and edit option and then click save).

Go to a Google Faucet (a site that gives free test ETH). The link is https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet. Select network as Etherum Sepolia and address from metamask setting go to address and select Etherum and  get some fake tokens in your account.

This faucet requires you to have a free Alchemy account. 
3. An API Key (Alchemy): To talk to the blockchain from our code, we need a stable connection. A "node provider" like Alchemy gives us this.
Action:
In your new Alchemy account, go to your Dashboard.
Click "Create new app"(If not made already by default).
Set the Chain to Ethereum and the Network to Sepolia.
Give it a name (like "My Wave App") and click "Create app".
Click on your new app's name, then click "View Key".
Find the HTTPS URL. It will look something like https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY. Copy this URL. We'll need it soon.
Alchemy URL : https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/VHSl86XJw_5TrKLx8UwqG


Step 2: Upgrade Your Hardhat Project
Now, let's go back to your VS Code project from Part A and make some changes.
A. Install dotenv to keep your keys safe
We need to store your new API key and wallet key securely.
In your Hardhat project terminal, run:

npm install dotenv
In the root of your project (the same level as hardhat.config.js), create a new file named .env
IMPORTANT: Open your .gitignore file and add this one line to the bottom. This stops you from ever accidentally uploading your secret keys to GitHub.
	.env
Open your new .env file and add two things:
The Alchemy HTTPS URL you copied.
Your MetaMask Private Key.
To get this: In MetaMask -> click the three dots (⋮) -> Account Details -> get Private Key.
WARNING: NEVER, EVER SHARE THIS KEY WITH ANYONE. IT IS THE MASTER KEY TO ALL YOUR FUNDS.
Your .env file should look like this:

ALCHEMY_API_URL="https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY"
SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"
B. Update hardhat.config.js
Replace your entire hardhat.config.js file with this. It's set up to read your .env file securely.
```
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config(); // Add this line

// Get the environment variables
const { ALCHEMY_API_URL, SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;

/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.24",
  networks: {
    // Add this 'sepolia' network configuration
    sepolia: {
      url: ALCHEMY_API_URL,
      accounts: [SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY]
    }
  }
};
```

C. Update your WavePortal.sol Contract
This is the new contract from your assignment. It adds structs to store messages.
Go to contracts/WavePortal.sol and replace all the code with this:
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract WavePortal {
    uint256 totalWaves;
    
    // This is a "struct" - a custom data type
    struct Wave {
        address sender; // The address of the person who waved
        string message;  // The message they sent
        uint256 timestamp; // The time the wave happened
    }

    // This is an array that will store all the Wave structs
    Wave[] waves;

    // This is an "event" - it's like a broadcast.
    // Our web app can listen for this to know a new wave happened.
    event NewWave(address indexed sender, string message, uint256 timestamp);

    constructor() {
        console.log("I am a smart contract, and I am ALIVE!");
    }

    // This function now takes a '_message' string
    function wave(string memory _message) public {
        totalWaves += 1;
        console.log("%s has waved with message: %s", msg.sender, _message);

        // Add a new Wave struct to our 'waves' array
        waves.push(Wave(msg.sender, _message, block.timestamp));

        // Emit the event so our web app can see it
        emit NewWave(msg.sender, _message, block.timestamp);
    }

    // Gets the total wave count
    function getTotalWaves() public view returns (uint256) {
        return totalWaves;
    }

    // Gets the full array of all Wave structs
    function getAllWaves() public view returns (Wave[] memory) {
        return waves;
    }
}
```
Important: Run npx hardhat compile again in your terminal to make sure the new contract compiles correctly.
Step 3: Deploy to the Sepolia Testnet
we'll use a proper deploy.js script.
Go to your scripts/ folder. Create a new file named deploy.js and paste this code:
```
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  // Get the "recipe" for the contract
  const waveContractFactory = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("WavePortal");
  
  // "Deploy" the contract (build it and put it on the blockchain)
  console.log("Deploying contract to Sepolia...");
  const waveContract = await waveContractFactory.deploy();
  
  // Wait for it to be officially deployed
  await waveContract.waitForDeployment();
  
  // Log the final address
  const contractAddress = await waveContract.getAddress();
  console.log("Contract deployed to:", contractAddress);
}

// Standard pattern to run the 'main' function and catch errors
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```
Now, run the deployment! This command tells Hardhat to use the --network sepolia config we added.
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

It will take about 15-30 seconds. You'll see: Deploying contract to Sepolia... Contract deployed to: 0x........................................
Success! You have deployed your contract to a public testnet. ACTION: COPY THIS DEPLOYED ADDRESS. IT'S CRUCIAL.
You can even copy that address and paste it into the search bar on sepolia.etherscan.io to see your contract living on the blockchain.

Sepolia address you can check : 0x79b0745bd4FF2226CD94DAf4bc6BB2afDfF4ABE3 
Step 4: Build Your Web App "Frontend"
Now we build the "control panel" (website) for your contract.
In your Hardhat project, create a new folder named frontend.
Inside frontend, create one file named index.html.
Paste all of the following code into index.html. This is a complete, minimal web app.
Copy code from here : https://github.com/Vinay-Basargekar/hardhat_Ethereum/tree/main/frontend
The "Magic" ABI (Application Binary Interface)
Your index.html file has a variable contractABI that is empty. We need to fill it.
In your VS Code project, navigate to this file: artifacts/contracts/WavePortal.sol/WavePortal.json
Open this file. It's a huge JSON file.
Find the key named "abi". It will be followed by a giant array [...].
Copy the entire array, starting from the [ and ending at the ].
Paste this array into the contractABI variable in your index.html file.
Step 5: Run Your Web App!
You can't just double-click the index.html file because of security rules. You need to serve it from a local web server.
The easiest way is with the VS Code "Live Server" extension:
In VS Code, go to the Extensions tab (the square icons).
Search for and install "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey.
Go back to your frontend/index.html file in the explorer.
Right-click on index.html.
Select "Open with Live Server".
Your web browser will automatically open, and you'll see your app!
To use it:
Click "Connect Wallet". MetaMask will pop up and ask for permission.
Once connected, your total wave count will load.
Type a message (e.g., "Hello from my first dApp!") in the box.
Click "Wave at Me!".
MetaMask will pop up again, asking you to "Confirm" the transaction. This is you paying the (Sepolia) gas fee to call the wave function.
Click "Confirm".
The button will say "Sending... ⏳". After 10-20 seconds (once the block is mined on Sepolia), the new wave will automatically appear at the top of your list!
Conclusion for Part B
You have successfully built and deployed a full-stack, decentralized application (dApp). You learned to:
Use a real wallet (MetaMask) and a public testnet (Sepolia).
Securely deploy a contract using an .env file and API key.
Build a web app frontend with ethers.js.
Connect your frontend to your backend (the contract) using its address and ABI.
Call both "read" functions (getTotalWaves) and "write" functions (wave), which require a signed transaction.
